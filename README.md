# Matsi

I have always loved games, and I have always loved wolves. So Matsi is the story of a young wolfling who wants to help a friend.
I chose the name Matsi in honor of the wolf Matsi from the Sawtooth pack. Knowing I loved wolves my grandmother bought me a package that allowed you to choose a wolf from the pack to sponsor/follow.
Masti was the wolf I chose to sponsor. The name means "sweet and brave" so it felt fitting for my story.
